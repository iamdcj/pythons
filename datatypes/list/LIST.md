# list

The `list` datatype represent an array-like collection of values in a list.


```
intList = [1,2,3,4,5]
textList = ["a", "b", "c"]
mixedList = [1, True, "David", 1.5]
```

The `list` data structure are:
    - ordered by number, indexed at 0
    - that can be accessed by their position in the collection, e.g. `list[1]`
    - are mutable, that is their contents can be changed
