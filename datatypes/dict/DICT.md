# dict

The `dict` datatype represents an unordered data structure in the language, allowing us to store data in an arbitrary manner.

Dictionaries in Python are very similar to objects in JavaScript.


```
someDict = {
    'a': [1,2,3],
    'b': False,
    'c': "HOLA"
}
```

Dictionary keys must be immutable, e.g. a string or a number.
