# Python

Python is a high-level, generally  interpreted* programming language, that is Python applications aren't compiled into a binary ahead of time, instead a program is required to translate the code during runtime so that the host machine understands the commands.

* this is dependant on the implemenation used to run/work with the code, for example CPython is the most widely-utilized implementation of the Python language.

Python utilises indentation to identify blocks of code, e.g. a function body or say the `if` block.
