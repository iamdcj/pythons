# Variables

Variables are used to store values within a programme.

```
someValue = "test"
```


## Rules

Variables in Python are case-sensitive must respect the following rules:

- can only contain numbers, letters, and underscores
- must begin with a letter or an underscore, not a number
- should not overwrite keywords


## Reassignment

Variables in Python can be reassigned, for example:

```
name = "David"

name = "Nole"

print(name)

# Nole

```

## Multiple Assignments

Python allows multiple variables to be initialized on a single line:

```
husband, wife, son = "David", "Steffie", "Nole"

```
