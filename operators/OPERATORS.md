# Operators

Python has a number of operators that allow programmers to perform all kinds of operations within their programs


## Operator Precedence
Operator precedence in the python language is consistent with mathematics:

```
print((1+4) * 1 * 3)

```

In the above example the operations within the brackets takes precedence over the multiplication outside of the brackets, as per regular math.
