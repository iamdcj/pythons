# `if...else`

The `'if...else` statement allows the engineer to control the flow of the program based on specific conditions, e.g.

```
age = 30

if age < 21:
    print('No drinking for you')
else:
    print('Come on in!')
```

## `elif`

Additonal conditionals can be added to extend the rules around the specified control flow:


```
age = 19

if age > 20:
    print('Come on in')
elif age > 17:
    print('This guest can enter but no drinks')
else:
    print('Piss off, young'un!')
```
